#### Assumptions
The Clojure and Clojurescript community would like more developers and companies to use Clojure.

Currently Clojure and Clojurescript have a steep learning curve for most developers. 
On top of the language looking completely foreign, getting set up for Clojure development can be time-consuming, frustrating, and difficult.

By discussing and analyzing the issues we think hamper more developers and companies from using Clojure, 
the community can plan and implement solutions that make learning and using it easier.

If we want to grow the community, lowering the cost to entry shows great potential: 
Few people who get past Clojure's initial challenges ever turn back.

## Approach
The main purpose of this repo is to provide a central place for the community to discuss and organize efforts to make Clojure easier to learn and use. 
 Where it makes sense, we can try to use a few basic software development methodologies and principles as guides.


**Create issues that define the problem**

Reasons Clojure hasn't become more widely used is discussed on social media with relative frequency. 
It's generally the same pain points being mentioned each time. 
A central repository for these issues can prevent us from having to identify them repeatedly and move us toward a more complete understanding of the barriers developers and companies face.

**Break large problems into subproblems**

Prior conversations have considered the potential reasons Clojure hasn't become more popular, but they haven't been able to consider any individual reason very deeply. 
Having a place where we can break the problem down can allow us to get to the bottom of each individual issue and arrive at a solution for it.

**Prioritization/impact**

Prioritizing issues by how much impact the community thinks a solution would have can allow us to have some idea of which are most important. 
This can allow interested contributors to avoid spending time on issues that the community as a whole doesn't think will make as much of a difference as other issues.

**Costing**

By considering the cost of implementation, the community and contributors can have a better idea of the amount of time and effort involved to implement one solution versus another. 
Cross referencing this with how much impact we estimate it will have might show us there are low cost, high value issues we can take on right away.
